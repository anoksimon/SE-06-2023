# C Programming Readme

## Introduction to C Programming

C programming is a powerful and widely-used programming language that provides low-level access to memory and a rich set of built-in functions. It was originally developed in the 1970s and continues to be a popular choice for system-level programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.

C is known for its efficiency, portability, and close-to-hardware control. It offers a straightforward syntax and a wide range of libraries, making it suitable for developing applications, utilities, and operating systems. It also serves as a foundation for many other programming languages.

## Installing GCC on Ubuntu 20.04

To compile and run C programs on Ubuntu 20.04, you need to install the GCC compiler. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Update the package list by running the command: `sudo apt update`.
3. Install GCC by running: `sudo apt install gcc`.

That's it! GCC is now installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 system, and you can start compiling and executing C programs.

## Installing GCC on Windows

To install GCC on Windows, you can use the MinGW-w64 distribution, which provides a port of the GCC compiler. Here's how you can install it:

1. Visit the MinGW-w64 website: [https://mingw-w64.org/](https://mingw-w64.org/).
2. Navigate to the "Downloads" section and select the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
3. Download the installer and run it.
4. During the installation process, select the components you want to install. Make sure to include the GCC compiler.
5. Complete the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

Once the installation is complete, you can use the GCC compiler to compile and run C programs on your Windows machine.

## Benefits of C Programming

C programming offers several advantages, including:

- **Efficiency**: C allows for fine-grained control over system resources, making it highly efficient in terms of memory usage and execution speed.
- **Portability**: C code can be easily ported to different platforms with minimal modifications, allowing for cross-platform development.
- **Close-to-Hardware Programming**: C provides low-level access to memory and system resources, making it suitable for system-level programming and hardware interfacing.
- **Large Standard Library**: C has a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functions for various tasks, from file handling to mathematical operations.
- **Compatibility**: Many other programming languages are compatible with C, allowing for easy integration and interoperability.

## Recorded C Class - Session 1

To dive deeper into the world of C programming, we highly recommend watching the recorded session of Class 1. In this session, we covered the fundamentals of C programming, syntax, variables, and basic control structures.
